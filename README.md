# Dashboard
A place to display our main KPIs and follow the evolution of TFTP

# Plan
We would like to have a dashboard in order to answer the following questions:

- how many members? Active? Inactive?
- how much money was collected so far? Where was is allocated?
- number of project in progress
- number of project done (up and running)
- impact on C02 emission

We could use https://dash.plotly for this purpose.
